        <p class="article-section-paragraph">For most electronic applications, filters are circuit blocks applied to an input signal to achieve a  desired output signal by picking out specific components of the signal. Filters are commonly classified as either low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-stop, depending on the type of signals they pick out. In the case of a low pass filter, an input signal is filtered by allowing low-frequency signals to pass without attenuation while rejecting high-frequency signals on the other hand:</p>

    <div>
        <p class="article-section-paragraph">A low pass filter can be constructed by using either active components such as transistors and operating amplifiers, or passive components such as resistors and capacitors. Particularly, a first-order passive low pass filter is an electronic circuit block consisting of a single resistor connected in series to a single capacitor. The input voltage is connected in series to the filter, while the output voltage is taken by measuring the voltage drop across the capacitor.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="article-section-paragraph">The filtering effect of a passive low pass filter is attained by taking advantage of the capacitor’s capacitive reactance, or the effective impedance of the circuit in sinusoidal inputs.</p>

    <div>
        <p class="article-section-paragraph">Intuitively at low frequencies, the expected output voltage has an amplitude less than or equal to that of the original input voltage. Moreover, at high frequencies, the expected output voltage would be highly attenuated. This input-output relationship can be mathematically derived from an application of voltage division:</p>

        <h3 class="article-section-header">Frequency Response</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="article-section-paragraph">The output of a passive low-pass filter can be further characterised by observing its frequency response. We can plot the filter's gain , expressed as the ratio between the input and output voltages of the circuit, over the frequency <strong>f</strong>at which the circuit operates. 
            Since electronic filters are used in a wide range of operating frequencies, it is convenient to make use of logarithmic Bode plots in plotting frequency response curves. Here, the vertical axis represents the gain (in decibels), and the horizontal axis represents the frequency (in decades). For reference, the equation used for computing the gain is given by:</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="article-section-paragraph">Note that the gain of the filter remains constant for lower frequencies, maintaining an output voltage approximately equal to the input voltage.
            Then at a certain frequency three decibels below the initial value, the gain begins to decrease to a constant slope. This is called the cut-off frequency, corner frequency, or the -3dB frequency of the low-pass filter. At this cut-off frequency, the output voltage is approximately 70.71% of the input voltage.
            Finally, at higher frequencies beyond the cut-off frequency, the output voltage decreases by a factor of ten (-20dB) for every decade.</p>

        <h3 class="article-section-header">Formula</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="article-section-paragraph">From the output voltage equation, we examine the reactance of the capacitor at the cut-off frequency <strong>f<sub>C</sub></strong>. At the cutoff frequency, the capacitive reactance is equal to the resistance of the resistor present in the low-pass filter:</p>

        <p class="article-section-paragraph">Substituting this expression for <strong>X<sub>C</sub></strong> to the output voltage equation, it can be proven that the output is approximately 70.71% of the input voltage:</p>

        <img src="./assets/images/Diagram 013.webp" alt="Calculation Diagram 13">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="article-section-paragraph">Furthermore, with this observation relating the passive elements in the passive low-pass filter, we can derive a formula for the cut-off frequency <strong>f<sub>C</sub></strong> in terms of the resistance and capacitance of the circuit:</p>

        <p class="article-section-paragraph">In this equation, <strong>R</strong> is the resistance value of the resistor used (in Ohms) while <strong>C</strong> is the capacitance value of the capacitor (in Farads) in the circuit. Note that the cut-off frequency is expressed in Hertz. Given this formula, if we are given two quantities out of the three (<strong>R, C, f<sub>C</sub></strong>) we can compute the missing third by using the online calculator above. The expressions used in computing the resistance and capacitance values are directly derived from the formula for the cut-off frequency:</p>
